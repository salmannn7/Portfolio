        "desc": "In the summer of 2023, I embarked on a passion project centred around the football club I support, Manchester United FC. This project was not only a labour of passion but also an opportunity to enhance my full-stack development skills. The web application I developed serves as a comprehensive database, containing detailed information about the club. While the project was intricate and showcased my ability to tackle complex tasks, it remained a work in progress. Unfortunately, I had to set it aside as I began my final year of university and could not complete it fully.\n\nKey Features:\n • Player Viewing: Users can explore detailed profiles of Manchester United players, including information such as their name, age, height, dominant foot, and on-field positions.\n • Team Setup: The team setup page allows users to create their ideal Manchester United lineup. Users can position their chosen players in any formation based on their historical roles and define specific team roles for each player. A dynamic lineup map displays the selected arrangement, showing how the team would look across different phases of play.\n • User Accounts: Registered users have the ability to add new players to the database. However, this feature is currently restricted to admin accounts only.\n\nDevelopment Highlights: \nInspired by my previous full stack projects from the units ‘Full Stack Development’ and ‘Thematic Project’, the tech stack remains as follows:\n • Server-side: Built with Express.JS, a Node.JS framework. Using this framework twice before, I had a much easier time developing this side of the project.\n • Client-side: Developed using Vue.JS, I also had a much easier time using this framework, furthering my experience with it and exploring different aspects of the framework such as the different lifecycle hooks and custom attributes.\n • Styling: Again using Tailwind, this styling framework was a walk in the park to me at this point, using it twice before and also my experience with CSS.\n\nAlthough this project remains incomplete, working on it ensured that I stayed sharp and prepared as I transitioned into my final year after the summer break. Along the way, I also acquired valuable new skills. More importantly, it taught me the value of pursuing passion projects as a means to refine my abilities. This experience has inspired me to undertake future personal endeavours in software development that are driven by my own interests, outside the framework of academic or institutional settings.",

        "desc": "In the autumn of 2024, I set out to recreate and reimagine the E-Commerce website I had developed as part of my Synoptic Project during my final year of university. While the original project focused on sneaker sales, this new iteration, titled ‘Uncanny’, is an original clothing-based site inspired by brands like Represent and Essentials. Post-graduation, I aimed to expand my skill set by exploring new frameworks and environments that I didn’t have the opportunity to work with during my time in education. This project served as both a creative outlet and a way to push my technical abilities further.\n\nKey Features:\nDue to the incompleteness of the project, the website is mainly a visual, not many features are included although the structure and styling of the website are appealing. The very few key features of the site include:\n • Product Viewing: Users can explore the different products of the website, including tracksuits, jackets, and t-shirts. However, the product variety is limited.\n • Product Filters: Users are able to filter the products via categories, colours, collections, and product types, with the filter options available being based upon all the products available on the website and uses the URL query to filter the products.\n • Product Sorting: Users are able to sort the products via featured, newest, prices from low to high, and prices from high to low.\n\nDevelopment Highlights: \nThis project features a completely new tech stack compared to my previous work, with changes to both the frontend and backend frameworks:\n • Server-side: The backend is built using Flask, a Python-based framework known for its simplicity and flexibility. I was inspired using this by a fellow colleague who utilised this framework in their Synoptic Project.\n • Client-side: For the first time, I utilised React.JS, a popular JavaScript framework. I chose React.js because many roles I’m pursuing specifically require experience with it. Despite being new to the framework, I was able to quickly grasp its concepts and implement it effectively and smoothly.\n • Styling: The styling framework remains Tailwind CSS, as I find it more optimal than alternatives like Bootstrap due to its flexibility and efficiency.\n\nAs this project is still incomplete and a relatively recent venture, as of writing this description, it hasn’t yet contributed significantly to my interpersonal development. However, from a technical perspective, it has been highly valuable. One of the most important skills I’ve gained is proficiency in React, which I hope to leverage in future roles. Additionally, this project reinforced the importance of simplicity and clean design when creating personal projects, underscoring the idea that less can often be more in web development.",
